## Introduction

Movie Recommender Systems are widely used in various online platforms, including streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. This project demonstrates how to build a basic movie recommender system using Python. The system recommends movies based on user behavior, such as movie ratings and user preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code from the provided Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Reethikaraj/movie_recommender_system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie_recommender_system
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `movie_recommender_system.ipynb` notebook.

5. Execute each cell in the notebook to run the code step by step.

6. The notebook will guide you through the implementation of the Movie Recommender System, including data loading, data preprocessing, and collaborative filtering for movie recommendations.

7. Customize the code and experiment with different datasets to adapt the recommender system to your requirements.

## Features
